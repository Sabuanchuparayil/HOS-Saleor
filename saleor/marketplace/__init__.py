"""Marketplace app for multi-vendor functionality."""

# Note: We don't import models or submodules here to avoid early model loading
# during Django setup. Submodules can still be imported directly:
#   from saleor.marketplace import models_loyalty
#   from saleor.marketplace import utils_loyalty
#   from saleor.marketplace import error_codes
